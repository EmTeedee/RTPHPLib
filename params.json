{"name":"Rtphplib","body":"RTPHPLib provides a class that wraps the REST API of Request Tracker.  To use, pass the URL, username, and password to the class constructor.  Then call whatever functions you want.  The RT response will be parsed into a PHP array. \r\n\r\nSee example.php for a demonstration of common actions.\r\n\r\nRequires the PHP curl extension.\r\n\r\nSee [the Request Tracker Wiki](http://requesttracker.wikia.com/wiki/REST) for information on available fields. Note that if a request type has mandatory fields, they are requested in the function\r\ncall, or (in certain cases) automatically added to the request.  So you don't need\r\nto specify the ticket id in content, or the type of action.\r\n\r\nPlease report any issues at https://github.com/dersam/RTPHPLib/issues ","tagline":"PHP wrapper for the Request Tracker API","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
