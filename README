See example.php for usage instructions.

Requires the pecl_http module to be installed.

See http://requesttracker.wikia.com/wiki/REST for information on available fields. 
Note that if a request type has mandatory fields, they are requested in the function
call, or (in certain cases) automatically added to the request.  So you don't need
to specify the ticket id in content, or the type of action.
